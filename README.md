# Viridis-color-map
* This python script converts black and white images to Viridis color.
* The script was made to convert Finite Element Analysis (FEA) results from Abaqus CAE to Viridis color map.
* Input images should be PNG files and located in the same directory with the python script.
* Part of this project was helped by GPT (sample image below, etc.)
